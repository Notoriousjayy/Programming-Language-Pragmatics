The files beneath this directory contain source code for almost all of
the nontrivial code fragments in Programming Language Pragmatics, 4e.
In most cases the code in the book does not constitute a complete and
runnable program, so these have been extended.  In general the goal has
been to create as small a program as possible that illustrates the
feature in question.  The result is not always good programming style.

In a few cases (generally when the point is to observe the behavior of
the compiler itself), the example is just a single module, and will not
produce runnable code.  These must typically be compiled with a "-c"
command-line switch.

Comments at the top of the source indicate the corresponding Example,
Figure, or Exercise in the book.  Code that appears both as an Example
or Exercise and as a Figure is provided in a directory named after the
Example or Exercise.

Code has been compiled and tested using the following compilers and
interpreters.  For languages that are still actively evolving, these
were up-to-date implementations as of the time of printing.  Some
historic languages may not compile and run on recent OS releases.
