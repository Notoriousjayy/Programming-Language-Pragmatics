{\bf Arrays}

\vskip 6pt
Array are the most common and important composite data type. Unlike {\bf records}, which group related fields of disparate types, arrays are usually homogeneous. Semantically, arrays can be thought of as a mapping from an {\bf index type} to a {\bf component type}.

\vskip 6pt
Some languages (notably scripting languages) allow nondiscrete index types. The resulting {associative arrays} must generally be implemented with hash tables or search trees. Associative arrays also resemble the {\bf dictionary} or {\bf map} types supported by the standard libraries of many object-oriented languages. We assume that array indices are discrete. This allows for a contiguous allocation scheme. We also asume arrays are dense---that is a large fraction of their elements  are not equal to zero or some other default value.
