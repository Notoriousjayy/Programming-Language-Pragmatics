{\bf Object Lifetime and Storage Management}

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Key events between $\underline{\hbox{names}}$ and the objects they refer to}:

\vskip 6pt
$\bullet$ Creation and destruction of objects

\vskip 6pt
$\bullet$ Creation and destruction of bindings

\vskip 6pt
$\bullet$ Deactivation and reactivation of bindings that may be temporarily unusable

\vskip 6pt
$\bullet$ References to variables, subroutines, types, and so on all of which use bindings

\vskip 12pt
{\bf Binding lifetime}: The period of time between the creation and the destruction of a $\underline{\hbox{name-to-object}}$ binding.

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Obect lifetime}: The period of time between the creation and destruction of an $\underline{\hbox{object}}$. An {\it object} may retain its $\underline{\hbox{value}}$ and the potential to be accessed even when a given {\it name} can no longer be used to access it.

\vskip 1mm
When a {\it variable} is passed to a subroutine by $\underline{\hbox{reference}}$, the {\it binding} between the $\underline{\hbox{parameter name}}$ and the {\it variable} that was passed has a {\it lifetime} shorter than that of the variable itself.

\vskip 6pt
A $\underline{\hbox{binding}}$ to an object that is no longer live is called a $\underline{\hbox{dangling reference}}$.

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Object lifetimes} generally correspond to one of the three $\underline{\hbox{storage allocation}}$ mechanisms, used to manage the object's space.

\vskip 6pt
$\underline{\hbox{{\bf Storage allocation mechanisms}:}}$

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Static}: Static objects are given an $\underline{\hbox{absolute address}}$ that is retained throughout the $\underline{\hbox{program's execution}}$.

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Stack}: Stack objects are $\underline{\hbox{allocated}}$ and $\underline{\hbox{deallocated}}$ in last-in, first-out (LIFO) order, usually in conjunction with {\it subroutines} and {\it returns}.

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Heap}: Heap objects may be {\it allocated} and {\it deallocated} at arbitrary times. They require a more general (expensive) $\underline{\hbox{storage management}}$ algorithm.

\vskip 6pt
When a variable is passed to a subroutine by {\bf reference}, the binding between the parameter name and the variable that was passed has a lifetime shorter than that of the variable itself.
