{\bf Static Allocation}
\vskip 1mm

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Global variables} are an example of $\underline{\hbox{static objects}}$.

\vskip 6pt
The instructions that constitute a program's $\underline{\hbox{machine code}}$ can be thought of as statically allocated objects.

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Variables} that are local to a single $\underline{\hbox{subroutine}}$, but retain their values from one inovcation to the next; their {\it space} is $\underline{\hbox{statically allocated}}$.

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Numeric} and {\bf String-valued} constant literals are $\underline{\hbox{statically allocated}}$.

\vskip 6pt
a Statically allocated objects whose value shoud not change during program execution are often allocated in protected, read-only memory, so that any inadvertent attempt to write to them will cause a processor interrupt, allowing the operating system to announce a run-time error.
